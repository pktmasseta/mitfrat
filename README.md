# pktmasseta.github.io/mitfrat | mitfrat.com
## What is this?  
This is the "mitfrat" subdomain of the PKT public website. mitfrat.com directs to this subdomain via a CNAME record created by the house Cloudflare account.  The domain was registered through our house GoDaddy account.

## What do I do with this?
The main use of this website is to provide a memorable domain that redirects to PKT content.  This is especially useful for Rush and CPW when we promote events like Poker Night.  mitfrat.com makes for a great website that can be chalked on the ground, or shared online to pub our materials.

## How do I change the content?
Edit the index.html file to deliver whatever content you desire.  This could be making a page to pub a party or event, or a redirect script that sends viewers to pkt.mit.edu or pkt.mit.edu/rush, or literally anything else you can think of.

Just make sure your changes are made in the gh-pages branch so that they are properly reflected.

## BE RESPONSIBLE
This domain is not only associated with our house but with MIT as well. Don't make this domain link to anything PKT or MIT would find undesireable or disrespectful.
